Todo-Pascal
===========

Simple task managment application (c) Vova Zolotoy 2014

Yeah, it's written in Pascal! Why? For fun! Pascal was
my first programing language. I miss it. I decide to use it
for developing small UNIX-style CLI application.

Commands:
	todo -v --version	: display software version
	todo -h --help		: show help index...
	todo add -t "Task"	: add new task
